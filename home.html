    <h1 >Our Technology</h1> 
    <p> 
        Green hydrogen is being produced by electrolysis, 
        which is a process that uses electricity to split
        water molecules (H2O) into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). 
        When electrolysis is combined with renewable electricity, 
        the production of fuels and chemicals can be decoupled 
        from fossil resources, paving the way for an energy system 
        based on 100% renewable energy.

        Electrolytic hydrogen production faces technological 
        challenges to improve its efficiency, economic value and 
        potential for global integration. In conventional water 
        electrolysis, the water oxidation and reduction reactions 
        are coupled in both time and space, as they occur simultaneously 
        at an anode and a cathode in the same cell. This introduces 
        challenges, such as product separation, and sets strict 
        constraints on material selection and process conditions. Here, 
        we decouple these reactions by dividing the process into two steps: 
        an electrochemical step that reduces water at the cathode and 
        oxidizes the anode, followed by a spontaneous chemical step 
        that is driven faster at higher temperature, which reduces 
        the anode back to its initial state by oxidizing water. This enables 
        overall water splitting at average cell voltages 
        of 1.44–1.60 V with nominal current densities of 10–200 mA cm−2 
        in a membrane-free, two-electrode cell. This allows us to produce 
        hydrogen at low voltages in a simple, cyclic process with 
        high efficiency, robustness, safety and scale-up potential.
        
        In our process we produce hydrogen and oxygen in two separate 
        steps in the first step we produce hydrogen at the cathode while 
        the anode is being charged without producing oxygen, this step is 
        carried out at room temperature then in the second step we heat up 
        the anode to discharge it without electricity in a completely 
        chemical and spontaneous process during this process the anode 
        releases the oxygen once it's discharged we can place it back in 
        the cold solution to continue hydrogen production.
